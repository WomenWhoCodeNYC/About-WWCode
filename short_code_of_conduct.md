# Code of Conduct

Women Who Code (WWCode) is dedicated to providing an empowering experience for everyone who participates in or supports our community, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, ability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or socioeconomic status.

Because we value the safety and security of our members and strive to have an inclusive community, we do not tolerate harassment of members or event participants in any form.

Our [Code of Conduct](code_of_conduct.md) applies to all events run by Women Who Code, Inc.

If you would like to report an incident or contact our leadership team, please submit an [incident report form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1NuBY_E2DcuJx2wtKFXyS5ZY5zZlql4jcZJqsf0sAs-0/viewform).
